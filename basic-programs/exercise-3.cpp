 * Find Quotient and Remainder
 *
 * Write a C++ Program to Find Quotient and Remainder of 2 numbers.
 * Hereâ€™s simple C++ Program to Find Quotient and Remainder of 2 numbers in C++ Programming Language.
 *
 * In this program, user is asked to enter two integers (divisor and dividend) and
 * computes the quotient and remainder.
 * To compute quotient and remainder, both divisor and dividend should be integers.
